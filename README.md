# WP Unit Test Stubs

A simple package used to help your IDE (Visual Studio Code, Sublime etc...) find class definitions for WordPress unit test classes.

## Usage

Install the package via Composer:

```shell
composer require sebkay/wp-unit-test-stubs --dev
```

Once your IDE has re-indexed your Composer dependencies you should be able to see class definitions for things like `WP_UnitTestCase`.

## Credit

These stubs were generated using [`phpstubs/generator`](https://github.com/php-stubs/generator) and inspired from the [`phpstubs/wordpress-stubs`](https://github.com/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs) package.
